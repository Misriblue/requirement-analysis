# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.
Requirement analysis is a crucial phase in the software development lifecycle where the needs and expectations of stakeholders are gathered, analyzed, and documented. This process lays the foundation for building a system that meets user goals and business objectives. By clearly defining functional and non-functional requirements, teams can avoid misunderstandings, reduce rework, and ensure the final product delivers value. Effective requirement analysis improves planning, guides design decisions, and contributes to the overall success of the software project.
## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, interpreting, and documenting the functional and non-functional requirements of a software system. It is typically one of the first and most critical phases in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

This phase involves working closely with stakeholders (clients, users, developers, testers, and business analysts) to understand what the system should do (functional requirements) and how it should perform (non-functional requirements like speed, security, or usability).
