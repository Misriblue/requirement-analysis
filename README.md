# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.
Requirement analysis is a crucial phase in the software development lifecycle where the needs and expectations of stakeholders are gathered, analyzed, and documented. This process lays the foundation for building a system that meets user goals and business objectives. By clearly defining functional and non-functional requirements, teams can avoid misunderstandings, reduce rework, and ensure the final product delivers value. Effective requirement analysis improves planning, guides design decisions, and contributes to the overall success of the software project.
## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, interpreting, and documenting the functional and non-functional requirements of a software system. It is typically one of the first and most critical phases in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

This phase involves working closely with stakeholders (clients, users, developers, testers, and business analysts) to understand what the system should do (functional requirements) and how it should perform (non-functional requirements like speed, security, or usability).
## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
1. Prevents Misunderstandings
Clear requirements ensure all stakeholders are aligned, reducing miscommunication.

2. Improves Design & Development
Well-defined requirements guide the architecture and design of the system, leading to better solutions.

3. Saves Time and Cost
Detecting errors early in the requirements phase is much cheaper than fixing them later during coding or testing.

4. Facilitates Testing
Requirements provide the basis for writing test cases and verifying that the software works as expected.

5. Enhances User Satisfaction
When software is built according to actual user needs, it increases adoption and satisfaction.
