# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.
Requirement analysis is a crucial phase in the software development lifecycle where the needs and expectations of stakeholders are gathered, analyzed, and documented. This process lays the foundation for building a system that meets user goals and business objectives. By clearly defining functional and non-functional requirements, teams can avoid misunderstandings, reduce rework, and ensure the final product delivers value. Effective requirement analysis improves planning, guides design decisions, and contributes to the overall success of the software project.
## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, interpreting, and documenting the functional and non-functional requirements of a software system. It is typically one of the first and most critical phases in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

This phase involves working closely with stakeholders (clients, users, developers, testers, and business analysts) to understand what the system should do (functional requirements) and how it should perform (non-functional requirements like speed, security, or usability).
## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
1. Prevents Misunderstandings
Clear requirements ensure all stakeholders are aligned, reducing miscommunication.

2. Improves Design & Development
Well-defined requirements guide the architecture and design of the system, leading to better solutions.

3. Saves Time and Cost
Detecting errors early in the requirements phase is much cheaper than fixing them later during coding or testing.

4. Facilitates Testing
Requirements provide the basis for writing test cases and verifying that the software works as expected.

5. Enhances User Satisfaction
When software is built according to actual user needs, it increases adoption and satisfaction.
## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.
+ Requirement Elicitation – Brainstorming in the context of software development

+ Requirement Gathering – Collecting requirements using interviews, surveys, use cases, and observations.

+ Requirement Documentation – Creating Software Requirements Specification (SRS) documents.

+ Requirement Validation – Ensuring requirements are clear, complete, and achievable.

+ Requirement Prioritization – Ranking requirements by importance or business value.
## Types of Requirements.
### Functional Requirements:
+ Users must be able to register with email and password.

+ Users can log in and log out securely.

+ Admins can view, edit, or delete user accounts.

Example:

+ A user enters their email and password, clicks "Register", and receives a confirmation email.
  ###  Non-functional Requirements:
+ The booking confirmation must be sent to the user within 5 seconds.

+ The system must be available 99.9% of the time (high availability).

+ The booking feature should be accessible via mobile and desktop.
  ## Use Case Diagrams
  Use Case Diagrams are a type of behavioral diagram in Unified Modeling Language (UML) that visually represents the functional interactions between users (actors) and a system. These diagrams describe the system's behavior from the perspective of external users (actors), showing how they interact with various use cases (functionalities or tasks the system performs).

### Key Components:
+ Actors: External entities (users, systems, or hardware) that interact with the system. Example: Customer, Admin.

+ Use Cases: Specific actions or functions that the system performs. Example: "Book Ticket", "Register User".

+ Associations: Lines that connect actors to the use cases, showing interaction.

+ System Boundary: A rectangle that defines the scope of the system (where the system begins and ends).
  ## Acceptance Criteria.
  Acceptance Criteria are a set of predefined conditions that a software product must meet to be accepted by the stakeholders (such as the client, user, or project team). These criteria define the functional and non-functional requirements that a system must fulfill to be considered complete and successful. They are usually specific, measurable, and clearly define when a feature or functionality is considered "done."

### Importance of Acceptance Criteria in Requirement Analysis
1.  Clear Expectations for All Stakeholders
Acceptance criteria provide a clear and shared understanding between the development team, business analysts, and stakeholders (clients, users) about what the system should do. By specifying detailed conditions, it ensures that everyone involved in the project knows what is expected, reducing ambiguity.

Example:
If the acceptance criteria for the "User Login" feature specify that "The system must allow users to log in within 3 seconds," it ensures that both the developers and stakeholders are aligned on the feature’s performance.

2. Guides the Development Process
With acceptance criteria in place, developers have a clear understanding of what they need to implement. This helps them to focus on the right functionality and minimizes the risk of scope creep (when extra features or changes are added without approval).

Example:
For a "Payment Processing" feature, if the acceptance criteria specify that "The system should handle up to 1,000 concurrent users without performance degradation," developers know the performance benchmarks to meet.

3. Provides a Basis for Testing
Acceptance criteria form the foundation for test cases and quality assurance (QA) validation. They help the QA team understand what to test and what conditions must be met for the feature to pass testing. Without these criteria, testing could be inconsistent and incomplete.

Example:
In the case of "Book Reservation," an acceptance criterion could be:

"The system must validate the availability of the selected room and inform the user within 5 seconds."
Testers will use this to verify that the system's response time is within the acceptable limit.

4. Prevents Miscommunication
Since acceptance criteria are written in simple, understandable language, they prevent any miscommunication between stakeholders. They ensure that both the client and the development team are on the same page regarding what features and functions will be delivered.

Example:
A feature like "User Profile Update" may have criteria like:

"Users must be able to update their email address and receive a confirmation email."
This removes any confusion about what exactly needs to be delivered and tested.

5. Facilitates Change Management
When requirements change during the development process, acceptance criteria help assess the impact of these changes. By clearly stating the acceptance conditions, changes can be made more systematically, ensuring they meet the new requirements.

Example:
If a change request asks for additional fields on a user profile, the acceptance criteria can be updated to include:

"Users must be able to update their phone number and address, and the system should validate the phone number format."

6. Supports Agile Methodology
In Agile software development, acceptance criteria are an essential part of the user stories. They help to define the scope of each story, ensuring the team delivers the right feature in the right way. Acceptance criteria provide clarity, making it easier to break down work into manageable chunks.
